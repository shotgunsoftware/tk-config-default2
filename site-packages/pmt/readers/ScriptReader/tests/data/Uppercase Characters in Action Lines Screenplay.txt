EXT. THE BEACH - DAY

An empty beach, except for a group of CHILDREN. Some of them are playing with a BALL, while others build a SAND CASTLE.

A little apart from them stands THOMAS, who is trying to catch shrimps in a small pound of water created by the tide.

INT/EXT. RAY'S CAR - DAY

RAY just stopped his car on the road along the beach, not far from the CHILDREN. He opens the rear door, as if to let someone in.

RAY
(talking loud to be sure to be heard)
Thomas, it's time to go home!

So tell me, did you have fun this afternoon?

THOMAS
(muttering)
Yeah...
