class BasicSceneCollector(HookBaseClass):
    """
    A basic collector that handles files and general objects.

    This collector hook is used to collect individual files that are browsed or
    dragged and dropped into the Publish2 UI. It can also be subclassed by other
    collectors responsible for creating items for a file to be published such as
    the current Maya session file.

    This plugin centralizes the logic for collecting a file, including
    determining how to display the file for publishing (based on the file
    extension).

    In addition to creating an item to publish, this hook will set the following
    properties on the item::

        path - The path to the file to publish. This could be a path
            representing a sequence of files (including a frame specifier).

        sequence_paths - If the item represents a collection of files, the
            plugin will populate this property with a list of files matching
            "path".

    """

        A dictionary of file type info that allows the basic collector to
        identify common production file types and associate them with a display

            {

            }

        See the collector source to see the default values returned.

        Subclasses can override this property, get the default values via
        ``super``, then update the dictionary as necessary by
        adding/removing/modifying values.
