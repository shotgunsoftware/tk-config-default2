        Publishes the file to Shotgun. A <b>Publish</b> entry will be

        the <b><a href='%s'>Loader</a></b> so long as they have access to
        the file's location on disk.

        <h3>File versioning</h3>
        The <code>version</code> field of the resulting <b>Publish</b> in
        Shotgun will also reflect the version number identified in the filename.

        A file can be published multiple times however only the most recent
