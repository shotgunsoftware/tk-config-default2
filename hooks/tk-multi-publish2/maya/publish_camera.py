    This class defines the required interface for a publish plugin. Publish

        A :class:`dict` defining the configuration interface for this plugin.

        The dictionary can include any number of settings required by the
        plugin, and takes the form::

            {
                <setting_name>: {

                ...
            }

        The keys in the dictionary represent the names of the settings. The
        values are a dictionary comprised of 3 additional key/value pairs.

        * ``type``: The type of the setting. This should correspond to one of
          the data types that toolkit accepts for app and engine settings such
          as ``hook``, ``template``, ``string``, etc.
        * ``default``: The default value for the settings. This can be ``None``.
        * ``description``: A description of the setting as a string.

        The values configured for the plugin will be supplied via settings
        parameter in the :meth:`accept`, :meth:`validate`, :meth:`publish`, and
        :meth:`finalize` methods.

        The values also drive the custom UI defined by the plugin whick allows
        artists to manipulate the settings at runtime. See the
        :meth:`create_settings_widget`, :meth:`set_ui_settings`, and
        :meth:`get_ui_settings` for additional information.

        .. note:: See the hooks defined in the publisher app's ``hooks/`` folder
           for additional example implementations.

        A :class:`list` of item type wildcard :class:`str` objects that this

        type string (see :meth:`~.processing.Item.create_item`). The strings
        provided by this property will be compared to each collected item's
        type.

        Only items with types matching entries in this list will be considered
        by the :meth:`accept` method. As such, this method makes it possible to
        quickly identify which items the plugin may be interested in. Any
        sophisticated acceptance logic is deferred to the :meth:`accept` method.

        property will be presented to this method.

        all keys are required. The keys are defined as follows:

          If ``False``, no task will be created for this plugin. Required.
        * ``enabled``: If ``True``, the created task will be enabled in the UI,
          otherwise it will be disabled (no interaction allowed). Optional,
          ``True`` by default.
        * ``visible``: If ``True``, the created task will be visible in the UI,
          otherwise it will be hidden. Optional, ``True`` by default.
        * ``checked``: If ``True``, the created task will be checked in the UI,
          otherwise it will be unchecked. Optional, ``True`` by default.

        In addition to the item, the configured settings for this plugin are
        supplied. The information provided by each of these arguments can be
        used to decide whether to accept the item.

        For example, the item's ``properties`` :class:`dict` may house meta data
        about the item, populated during collection. This data can be used to
        inform the acceptance logic.
