FADE IN:

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DEWY MORNING

We are introduced to our first location: a small courthouse buried in the middle of the city.

We slowly enter the building through a window. Inside, a stout JUDGE slams their gavel as a rowdy CROWD watches.

INT. COURTHOUSE - DEWY MORNING

JUDGE

Order in the court! I will not have the trouble of this husting bustle!

The CROWD quiets down as we slowly make our way to the front of the room, where the DEFENDANT sits idle.

A sleazy DEFENSE ATTORNEY comes forward.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY

Now now, there is no need for this upset.

DEFENDANT

(Very angry)

They can be as upset as they want, this trial is complete malarkey! An absolute sham!

The defense attorney squirms a little at the temperament of their client.

DEFENDANT

I waive my right to an attorney, I don't need this sleaze representing me anymore!

INT. JAIL CELL - NOON

The DEFENDANT sits idle in their cell.

DEFENDANT

(Muttering)

What a crock of rubbish...

PRISON GUARD

(Disdainful)

Hey, you've got company.

The cell door opens and THE FIXER walks in. A little gaunt but sharply dressed, they mean business.

THE FIXER

Heard you ditched your last lawyer?

DEFENDANT

(Put on the spot)

He was useless anyways.

THE FIXER

Eh. The boss won't like that at all.

EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

THE FIXER dumps a carpet in the bay.
