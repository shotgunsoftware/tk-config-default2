# The keys section contains the definitions for all the different keys that are being

# {Shot}. The section below tells Sgtk which data types and formats to expect for each key.

#
# The paths section contains all the the key locations where files are to be stored
# by Sgtk Apps. Each path is made up of several keys (like {version} or {shot}) and
# these are defined in the keys section above.
#
# Apps use these paths as part of their configuration to define where on disk
# different files should go.
#
# In this default configuration, all of the root_name keys will be set to 'primary'.
# This is because the default configuration stores all its production data in a single
# tree and hence uses a single root folder on disk. If you wanted to extend the
# configuration to span multiple root points, for example because you want to store
# renders on a different server, you could define an additional root in Shotgun, and
# then switch any relevant templates to point to that one instead.
#

paths:

    # Common  path definitions to use as shorthand in order to avoid repetitive and verbose
    # templates. This also makes it easy to change any of the common root paths and have the
    # changes apply to all templates that use them.
    #
    # These don't require the standard formatting (with definition and root_name) because they
    # will be set within each template that uses the alias.
