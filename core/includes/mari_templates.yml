# This file is one of the central points in the Shotgun Pipeline Toolkit configuration and
# a counterpart to the folder configuration structure.
#
# The folder structure underneath the project folder is used to create folders on disk -
# templates.yml (this file) refers to those folders. Therefore, the two files need to be
# in sync. This file contains an overview of all locations that are used by Sgtk.
#
# Whenever an app or an engine refers to a location on disk, it is using an entry defined in
# this file. For more information, see the Shotgun Pipeline Toolkit Documentation.
#
# The keys section contains the definitions for all the different keys that are being
# used by Sgtk. A key is a magic token that is replaced by a value at runtime, for example
# {Shot}. The section below tells Sgtk which data types and formats to expect for each key.

keys:
    mari.channel:
        type: str
        alias: channel
    mari.layer:
        type: str
        alias: layer
    mari.project_name:
        type: str
        alias: name

# The paths section contains all the the key locations where files are to be stored
# by Sgtk Apps. Each path is made up of several keys (like {version} or {shot}) and
# these are defined in the keys section above.
#
# Apps use these paths as part of their configuration to define where on disk
# different files should go.
#
# In this default configuration, all of the root_name keys will be set to 'primary'.
# This is because the default configuration stores all its production data in a single
# tree and hence uses a single root folder on disk. If you wanted to extend the
# configuration to span multiple root points, for example because you want to store
# renders on a different server, you could define an additional root in Shotgun, and
# then switch any relevant templates to point to that one instead.

paths:
    asset_mari_texture_exr:
        definition: '@asset_root/publish/mari/v{version}/{mari.channel}_v{version}/exr/{Asset}_{mari.channel}[_{mari.layer}].v{version}.{UDIM}.exr'
        root_name: 'project_pipeline'
    asset_mari_texture_tx:
        definition: '@asset_root/publish/mari/v{version}/{mari.channel}_v{version}/tx/{Asset}_{mari.channel}[_{mari.layer}].v{version}.{UDIM}.tx'
        root_name: 'project_pipeline'
    asset_mari_texture_rat:
        definition: '@asset_root/publish/mari/v{version}/{mari.channel}_v{version}/rat/{Asset}_{mari.channel}[_{mari.layer}].v{version}.{UDIM}.rat'
        root_name: 'project_pipeline'

strings:
    # Define a new Mari project name
    mari_asset_project_name: "{mari.project_name} - Asset {asset_name}, {task_name}"
