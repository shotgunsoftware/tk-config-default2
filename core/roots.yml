# This file defines all the different disk locations that this config uses.
#
# Root definitions are referenced from the toolkit configuration's templates.yml
# file and folder creation schema.
#
# At setup time, each defined root is looked up against the local storages
# defined in shotgun. For each root defined in this file, a local storage needs
# to exist in Shotgun. The `shotgun_storage_id` key in each root definition
# below should correspond to a local storage in Shotgun. This allows the roots
# defined here to be called anything, making it possible to reuse the
# configuration without changing references to the storage root, only the
# associated SG storage id. If the `shotgun_storage_key` is not defined, then
# the root name must match the name of the storage in SG (legacy fallback).
#
# NOTE: Local storages ids can only be retrieved via the API currently:
#
#    # get all local storages defined in SG
#    shotgun.find("LocalStorage", [], ["code"])
#
# One of the roots defined in this file should have a `default` key with a value
# of `true` to identify the default storage root to use when none is specified
# for a path template. If no roots are identified a `default`, then one root
# must be named `primary` which will indicate the default root.
#
# During setup, the paths defined for each local storage are transferred across
# to this file.
#
# Note: In toolkit core versions prior to 0.18.121, configurations using a
# single root required this root to be named 'primary'. In later versions of
# core, this requirement has been lifted and the root can be named anything.
