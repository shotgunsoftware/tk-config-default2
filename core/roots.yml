# This file defines all the different disk locations that this config uses.
# Root definitions are referenced from the toolkit configuration's templates.yml
# file and folder creation schema.

# At setup time, each defined root is looked up against the local storages defined
# in shotgun. For each root defined in this file, a local storage with the same name
# needs to exist in Shotgun. During setup, the paths defined for each local storage
# are transferred across to this file.

# Note: In toolkit core versions prior to 0.18.121, configurations using a single
# root required this root to be named 'primary'. In later versions of core, this
# requirement has been lifted and the root can be named anything.
