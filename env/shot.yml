description: Apps and engines loaded when a Shot is loaded. Since std VFX config
  template has a file system structure which is centered around pipeline steps,
  this environment is largely empty. Most of the work takes place on a level in
  the file system where both a shot and a pipeline step is available - e.g Shot
  ABC, modeling, so all apps for loading, publishing etc. are located in the
  shot_step environment. This environment mostly contains utility apps and the
  tank work files app, which lets you choose a task to work on and load
  associated content into an application.
