description: Apps and engines loaded when a Shot is loaded. Since std VFX config template
  has a file system structure which is centered around pipeline steps, this environment
  is largely empty. Most of the work takes place on a level in the file system where
  both a shot and a pipeline step is available - e.g Shot ABC, modeling, so all apps
  for loading, publishing etc. are located in the shot_step environment. This environment
  mostly contains utility apps and the tank work files app, which lets you choose
  a task to work on and load associated content into an application.
