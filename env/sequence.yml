description: Apps and engines loaded when a Sequence is loaded. Since std VFX
  config template has a file system structure which is centered around pipeline
  steps, this environment is largely empty. Most of the work takes place on a
  level in the file system where both a shot and a pipeline step is available -
  e.g Shot ABC, modeling, so all apps for loading, publishing etc. are located
  in the shot_step environment. This environment mostly contains utility apps
  and the tank work files app, which lets you choose a task to work on and load
  associated content into an application.
