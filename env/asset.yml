description: Apps and engines loaded when an Asset is loaded. Since std VFX
  config template has a file system structure which is centered around pipeline
  steps, this environment is largely empty. Most of the work takes place on a
  level in the file system where both an asset and a pipeline step is available
  - e.g Asset Hero, modeling, so all apps for loading, publishing etc. are
  located in the asset_step environment. This environment mostly contains
  utility apps and the tank work files app, which lets you choose a task to work
  on and load associated content into an application.
